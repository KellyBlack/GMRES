A c++ implementation of the GMRES method for approximating the solution to a linear system.

This set of software is composed of Several include files that define template functions to implement the GMRES method. The code is based on the GMRES method with restarts. The code is influenced by the IML++ implementation as well as John Burkardt\textquotesingle{}s MATLAB implementation.

Please see the file latex/refman.\+pdf for more details on how to use the code. An example of how to use the code can be found in the example directory.
