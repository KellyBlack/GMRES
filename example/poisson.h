 * @section DESCRIPTION
 *
 * Class to keep track of the operator and its  linearization  for a PDE.
 *
 * This is the definition (header) file for the Poisson class. It
 * includes the definitions for the methods and the data used to keep
 * track of the operator that defines a given PDE. It is assumed that
 * the operator is in the form Lu=0, and this class keeps track of L
 * and its linearization that is used for a GMRES procedure.
 *
 *
 * @brief header file for the basic operations associated with the
 * operator associated with a PDE.
